#### About

This is a semantic HTML, modern CSS responsive landing page using BEM about traveling across the US. Taking a [figma design](https://www.figma.com/file/AtbNbstbxWPcMqvF061V0R/Sprint-3%3A-From-Portland-to-Portland-%7C-desktop-%2B-mobile?node-id=0%3A1) I've made it so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes.
